In this case, whether this is a cat image (1) or a non-cat image \n(0). \n \n \n \n \n \nAn image is store in the computer in three separate matrices corresponding to the Red, Green, and Blue \ncolor  channels of  the  image.  The  three  matrices have  the  same  size  as  the image,  for  example, the \nresolution of the cat image is 64 pixels X 64 pixels, the three matrices (RGB) are 64 X 64 each.  \nThe value in  a  cell  represents the  pixel  intensity  which  will  be  used  to  create  a  feature  vector  of  n-\ndimension.  In  pattern  recognition  and  machine  learning, a feature  vector represents  an object,  in  this \ncase, a cat or no cat. \nTo create a feature vector, 푥, the pixel intensity values will be “unroll” or “reshape” for each color. The \ndimension of the input feature vector 푥 is 푛\n푥\n=64 푥 64 푥 3=12 288. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n64 \n64 \nred \ngreen \nblue ",
